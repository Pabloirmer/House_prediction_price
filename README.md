House price Prediction using a MLR model 

# House Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model. The dataset includes various features related to houses, such as lot size, year built, and overall quality.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a sample representation of typical house price data, including features like `LotFrontage`, `LotArea`, `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`, and `SalePrice`.

## Project Structure
- `House_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

## Analysis and Results
The analysis includes handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and building a linear regression model. The initial model evaluation showed high error values, indicating the need for further improvements.

## Future Work
- Use a larger dataset for more accurate predictions.
- Implement feature engineering and selection.
- Experiment with different machine learning models and tuning hyperparameters.

## Acknowledgments
The dataset used in this project is a simulated representation for demonstration purposes.
